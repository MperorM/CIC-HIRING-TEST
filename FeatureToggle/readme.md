# Feauture toggle

## Roles
* Frontend
* Backend
* Fullstack

## Description
Your team has successfully completed a given assignment. You have the most wonderous and fantastic prototype up and running and you're ready to show the world! - before you get to the product owner pops her head in and says: "Are you guys ready to scale?"
You look to eachother in shock and you say... no, you only gave us a eight weeks to complete this. 

Common problem. Common solution. 

This project is all about being able to toggle features based on if they are working or not or if you just manually need to take down some features. 

Say for instance there is a bug in the "register user feature" you could switch that off so that no malformed data enters your system - it should've have been tested and found before production but accidents happen!
## Tasks
all tasks are described as "user stories" - simply put a user wants to be able to do this, you come up with how they are going to do it. **You're not meant to do all stories but as many as you can and in no particular order.**

### a note on mocking
You will need to mock a system here (you don't actually have to have a ready system to feature toggle). 
If you already have something you can implement this into, great - if not, just make it up. Make a note if you want the mocked system to be reviewed or not. 

At the minimum a login system should be made though (mock data) this is to have aomething to mock on 

### Login system v: mock - 0.0.1
* Bjarke would like to register himself as a user
* Bjarke would like to login to the system
* Gemma would like to reset her password as she forgot it.

### Adding toggle feautures, (they don't have work yet) 
* Bjórn wants a way he can add a feature toggle for registering users
* Bjórn would like to be able to edit the feature toggle he just made
* Samantha has made a special feature and event for halloween for the webstore, she would like to set up a toggle for it


### Enforcing toggles, (now they do)
* Samantha wants to turn on and off  the register user functionality
* Bjórn would like to turn off the reset password feature as the SMTP server broke.
* Samantha would like a way to clearly communicate which functions are working and which are not.
* Bjórn would like to tell the users what went wrong and why that feature is disabled

### Schedules 
* Samantha would like to be able to set a time period login should be disabled
* Samantha would like to define weekly schedules for when features should be disabled.
* Bjórn is lost in the data and would like an easy way to update the schedules for the toggles.
* Bjórn would like to autmatically have the halloween feature running every year at halloween


### Note on roles
You do not need a graphical interface if you are a backender, as you do not need a backend if you are a frontender! Mock what you can or skip tasks that does not make sense if that is not what you are applying for.
